- bicycle1: A shallow embedding
- bicycle2: A deep embedding (may violate monad laws)
- bicycle3: A deep embedding (satisfies monad laws)
- bicycle4: A deep embedding using a free monad.
- bicycle5: A deep embedding using the free library
- bicycle7: A deep embedding using an operational approach
- bicycle6: A deep embedding using the operational monad
